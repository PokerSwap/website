<p>For each visitor to the Swap Profit app,&nbsp;Swap Profit&nbsp;servers automatically collect information about which pages are visited and the IP address or domain name of visitors. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web Site. Your IP address is not linked to personally identifiable information but is used to gather broad demographic information. This information helps us tailor and improve your experience on the Web Site.</p>
<p><strong>Information we collect:</strong></p>
<p>1. General: Portions of&nbsp;Swap Profit&nbsp;require visitors to provide personally identifiable information that may include your name, age, address, e-mail address, credit-card number and facts about your consumer-buying habits. We do not, however, knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18.</p>
<p>2. Web site usage: We automatically collect IP addresses and web site usage information from you when you visit our site. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors use and navigate our web sites on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors to each web page, the length of their visits, their browser type and their operating systems.</p>
<p><strong>How we use information that is collected:</strong></p>
<p>Swap Profit&nbsp;may use information collected from visitors in the following ways:</p>
<p>1. To improve existing features or develop new features, products and services by analyzing how site features are being used.</p>
<p>2. To award prizes in contests or promotions. Participation in some contests or promotions may require visitors to agree to be contacted by&nbsp;Swap Profit.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;To provide advertisers or other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns. Personally identifiable information is kept private and not distributed to third parties.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;To send e-mail notifications about new or existing products and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you. These contacts are on an opt-in basis only, based on the preferences you have specified with&nbsp;Swap Profit.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong></p>
<p>Swap Profit may place a "cookie"; on the browser of your computer. Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common in the Internet industry, and many major web sites use them to provide useful features to their customers. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information, but may be used to tell when your computer has contacted the Swap Profit site. Swap Profit uses the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as delivery of features and advertisements, so that Swap Profit can customize delivery of information specific to your interests without compromising privacy. For example, cookies may be used to ensure that you will not see the same ads too often in a single session. &nbsp;We also may use cookies to save your passwords so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit portions of our site.</p>
<p><strong>Registration:</strong></p>
<p>Swap Profit&nbsp;requires voluntary registration in order to utilize specific features. These forms require you to give us personally identifiable information, which may include contact information (like your name and e-mail address) and unique identifiers. If you so signify beforehand, we may use your contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. Unique identifiers are collected only for use as account numbers in our record system. We do not disclose any unique identifiers to any third parties.</p>
<p>The information collected from these registration forms is used to improve existing features or develop new features, products and services by analyzing how site features are being used. Such information may be shared with third parties on an aggregate basis.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and profile data:</strong></p>
<p>We also may collect demographic and profile data from you as part of the registration process (i.e., your zip code, age, gender, interest in certain topics). We may use this data to tailor your experience at our site, showing you content we think you might be interested in, displaying the content according to your preferences and informing you of upcoming events on our site. We also share certain demographic and profile data with advertisers and business partners on an aggregated basis.</p>
<p>Swap Profit&nbsp;will disclose account information only in special cases, such as (i) to comply with valid legal requirements, such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (ii) when Swap Profit&nbsp;has reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who, intentionally or unintentionally, may be causing injury or harm to&nbsp;Swap Profit&nbsp;users or other persons or violating the Terms of Service of this site.</p>
